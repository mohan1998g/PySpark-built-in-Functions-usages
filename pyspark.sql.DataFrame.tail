pyspark.sql.DataFrame.tail

Returns the last num rows as a list of Row.

Running tail requires moving data into the applicationâ€™s driver process, and doing so with a very large num can crash the driver process with OutOfMemoryError.

Parameters
num : int
          Number of records to return. 
          Will return this number of records or all records if the DataFrame contains less than this number of records.

Returns : list
          List of rows

Examples

df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [(14, "Tom"), (23, "Alice"), (16, "Bob")], ["age", "name"])
df.tail(2)
[Row(age=23, name='Alice'), Row(age=16, name='Bob')]
