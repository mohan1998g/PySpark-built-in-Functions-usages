pyspark.sql.DataFrame.explain

Prints the (logical and physical) plans to the console for debugging purposes.

Parameters
extended : bool, optional
            default False. If False, prints only the physical plan. 
            When this is a string without specifying the mode, it works as the mode is specified.

mode : str, optional
            specifies the expected output format of plans.

simple: Print only a physical plan.

extended: Print both logical and physical plans.

codegen: Print a physical plan and generated codes if they are available.

cost: Print a logical plan and statistics if they are available.

formatted: Split explain output into two sections: a physical plan outline and node details.

Changed in version 3.0.0: Added optional argument mode to specify the expected output format of plans.

Examples

df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [(14, "Tom"), (23, "Alice"), (16, "Bob")], ["age", "name"])
Print out the physical plan only (default).

df.explain()  
== Physical Plan ==
*(1) Scan ExistingRDD[age...,name...]
Print out all of the parsed, analyzed, optimized and physical plans.

df.explain(True)
== Parsed Logical Plan ==
...
== Analyzed Logical Plan ==
...
== Optimized Logical Plan ==
...
== Physical Plan ==
...
Print out the plans with two sections: a physical plan outline and node details

df.explain(mode="formatted")  
== Physical Plan ==
* Scan ExistingRDD (...)
(1) Scan ExistingRDD [codegen id : ...]
Output [2]: [age..., name...]
...
Print a logical plan and statistics if they are available.

df.explain("cost")
== Optimized Logical Plan ==
...Statistics...
...
