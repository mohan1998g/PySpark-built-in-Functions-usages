pyspark.sql.DataFrame.isStreaming

Returns True if this DataFrame contains one or more sources that continuously return data as it arrives. A DataFrame that reads data from a streaming source must be executed as a StreamingQuery using the start() method in DataStreamWriter. Methods that return a single answer, (e.g., count() or collect()) will throw an AnalysisException when there is a streaming source present.

Returns : bool
        Whether itâ€™s streaming DataFrame or not.

Examples

df = spark.readStream.format("rate").load()
df.isStreaming
True
