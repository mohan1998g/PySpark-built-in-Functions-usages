pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toPandas

Returns the contents of this DataFrame as Pandas pandas.DataFrame.

This is only available if Pandas is installed and available.

Notes

This method should only be used if the resulting Pandas pandas.DataFrame is expected to be small, as all the data is loaded into the driverâ€™s memory.

Usage with spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled=True is experimental.

Examples

df.toPandas()  
   age   name
0    2  Alice
1    5    Bob
